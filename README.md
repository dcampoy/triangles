# Triangles
Prints any image using just semi-transparent triangles.
 
It was during a casual conversation with a coworker about how to optimise sale stock when the concept of genetic algorithm came out. I had heard about this approach years ago in the university but never saw any working example.

To illustrate the problem, he pointed me how [Roger Johansson](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/)  was able to organise 50 polygons to represent the Da Vinci's Gioconda. Immediately, I loved the idea and I tried to replicate it in PHP and ImageMagick. But the final result disappointed me as I couldn't experiment with the parameters because the convergence was taking hours.

Two years later, I've implemented the same code but in C++ using SDL. The result is a 75x acceleration that means that now I only need to wait five minutes instead of five hours to get a result.

The algorithms starts with a randomly generated candidate that is considered the best one so far. Then, in every iteration, a new candidate is generated as a random mutation from the previous one. Following the analogy with the nature, this new candidate will be called "child" and the initial one "parent". If the image generated by the child is closer to the target than the parent's one, the child take the place of the parent.

## Examples

image| beach.jpg
size | 128x192 
triangles | 40
calculation time | 10 minutes
iterations | 400k

triangles | 180
calculation time | 10 minutes
